   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.
