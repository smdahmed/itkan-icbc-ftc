/*
 * This OpMode is an example driver-controlled (TeleOp) mode for the goBILDA 2024-2025 FTC
 * Into The Deep Starter Robot
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This robot has a two-motor differential-steered (sometimes called tank or skid steer) drivetrain.
 * With a left and right drive motor.
 * The drive on this robot is controlled in an "Arcade" style, with the left stick Y axis
 * controlling the forward movement and the right stick X axis controlling rotation.
 * This allows easy transition to a standard "First Person" control of a
 * mecanum or omnidirectional chassis.
 *
 * The drive wheels are 96mm diameter traction (Rhino) or omni wheels.
 * They are driven by 2x 5203-2402-0019 312RPM Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotors.
 *
 * This robot's main scoring mechanism includes an arm powered by a motor, a "wrist" driven
 * by a servo, and an intake driven by a continuous rotation servo.
 *
 * The arm is powered by a 5203-2402-0051 (50.9:1 Yellow Jacket Planetary Gearmotor) with an
 * external 5:1 reduction. This creates a total ~254.47:1 reduction.
 * This OpMode uses the motor's encoder and the RunToPosition method to drive the arm to
 * specific setpoints. These are defined as a number of degrees of rotation away from the arm's
 * starting position.
 *
 * Make super sure that the arm is reset into the robot, and the wrist is folded in before
 * you run start the OpMode. The motor's encoder is "relative" and will move the number of degrees
 * you request it to based on the starting position. So if it starts too high, all the motor
 * setpoints will be wrong.
 *
 * The wrist is powered by a goBILDA Torque Servo (2000-0025-0002).
 *
 * The intake wheels are powered by a goBILDA Speed Servo (2000-0025-0003) in Continuous Rotation mode.

        We can multiply these two ratios together to get our final reduction of ~254.47:1.

            Encoders report when the motor has moved a specified angle. They send out pulses which
            only occur at specific intervals (see our ARM_TICKS_PER_DEGREE). This means that the
            position our arm is currently at can be expressed as a whole number of encoder "ticks".
            The encoder will never report a partial number of ticks. So we can store the position in
            an integer (or int).
            A lot of the variables we use in FTC are doubles. These can capture fractions of whole
            numbers. Which is great when we want our arm to move to 122.5Â°, or we want to set our
            servo power to 0.5.

            setTargetPosition is expecting a number of encoder ticks to drive to. Since encoder
            ticks are always whole numbers, it expects an int. But we want to think about our
            arm position in degrees. And we'd like to be able to set it to fractions of a degree.
            So we make our arm positions Doubles. This allows us to precisely multiply together
            armPosition and our armPositionFudgeFactor. But once we're done multiplying these
            variables. We can decide which exact encoder tick we want our motor to go to. We do
            this by "typecasting" our double, into an int. This takes our fractional double and

        // forward (positive Y) of the center of the robot, and mounted 90 degrees
        // clockwise (negative rotation) from the robot's orientation, the offset

        // first set both scalars to 1.0, then calibrate the angular scalar, then
        // the linear scalar. To calibrate the angular scalar, spin the robot by
        // multiple rotations (eg. 10) to get a precise error, then set the scalar
        // to the inverse of the error. Remember that the angle wraps from -180 to
        // 180 degrees, so for example, if after 10 rotations counterclockwise
        // (positive rotation), the sensor reports -15 degrees, the required scalar
        // would be 3600/3585 = 1.004. To calibrate the linear scalar, move the
        // robot a known distance and measure the error; do this multiple times at
        // multiple speeds to get an average, then set the linear scalar to the
        // inverse of the error. For example, if you move the robot 100 inches and
        // the sensor reports 103 inches, set the linear scalar to 100/103 = 0.971

        // when it powers up, but it is recommended to perform a more thorough
        // calibration at the start of all your OpModes. Note that the sensor must
        // be completely stationary and flat during calibration! When calling
        // calibrateImu(), you can specify the number of samples to take and whether
        // to wait until the calibration is complete. If no parameters are provided,
